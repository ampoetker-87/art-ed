It depicts a farmer standing beside his daughter – often mistakenly assumed to be his wife. The painting is named for the house's architectural style. The figures were modeled by Wood's sister Nan Wood Graham and their dentist Dr. Byron McKeeby. The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 20th-century rural Americana while the man is adorned in overalls covered by a suit jacket and carries a pitchfork. The plants on the porch of the house are mother-in-law's tongue and beefsteak begonia, which also appear in Wood's 1929 portrait of his mother, Woman with Plants.

The site was refurbished in 1990 and 1991 to replicate van Gogh's painting. He looked south towards the artificially lit terrace of the popular coffee house, as well as into the enforced darkness of the rue du Palais which led up to a building structure (to the left, not pictured) and, beyond this structure, the tower of a former church which is now Musée Lapidaire. \\n Towards the right, Van Gogh indicated a lighted shop as well and some branches of the trees surrounding the place, but he omitted the remainders of the Roman monuments just beside this little shop. \\n The painting is currently at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, Netherlands.\",\n  source: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Terrace_at_Night\",\n  value: \"8\"\n}, {\n  id: 9,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1183992/pexels-photo-1183992.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"9\"\n}, {\n  id: 10,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1939485/pexels-photo-1939485.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"10\"\n}, {\n  id: 11,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1145720/pexels-photo-1145720.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"1\"\n}, {\n  id: 12,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1616403/pexels-photo-1616403.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"2\"\n}, {\n  id: 13,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1194420/pexels-photo-1194420.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"3\"\n}, {\n  id: 14,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1910236/pexels-photo-1910236.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"4\"\n}, {\n  id: 15,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3631430/pexels-photo-3631430.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"5\"\n}, {\n  id: 16,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/971546/pexels-photo-971546.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"6\"\n}, {\n  id: 17,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1012982/pexels-photo-1012982.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"7\"\n}, {\n  id: 18,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1572386/pexels-photo-1572386.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"8\"\n}, {\n  id: 19,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1183992/pexels-photo-1183992.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"9\"\n}, {\n  id: 20,\n  img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1939485/pexels-photo-1939485.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n  details: \"Description here\",\n  value: \"10\"\n}];\n\nfunction shuffleArray() {\n  for (var i = cards.length - 1;

The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief. The painting soon became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped bring worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War.\",\n        source: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(Picasso)\",\n        value: \"5\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 6,\n        title: \"American Gothic\",\n        img: \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Grant_Wood_-_American_Gothic_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/240px-Grant_Wood_-_American_Gothic_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\",\n        details: \"American Gothic is a 1930 painting by Grant Wood in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Wood was inspired to paint what is now known as the American Gothic House in Eldon, Iowa, along with 'the kind of people [he] fancied should live in that house'. It depicts a farmer standing beside his daughter – often mistakenly assumed to be his wife. The painting is named for the house's architectural style. The figures were modeled by Wood's sister Nan Wood Graham and their dentist Dr. Byron McKeeby. The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 20th-century rural Americana while the man is adorned in overalls covered by a suit jacket and carries a pitchfork. The plants on the porch of the house are mother-in-law's tongue and beefsteak begonia, which also appear in Wood's 1929 portrait of his mother, Woman with Plants. American Gothic is one of the most familiar images of 20th-century American art and has been widely parodied in American popular culture. From 2016 to 2017, the painting was displayed in Paris at the Musée de l'Orangerie and in London at the Royal Academy of Arts in its first showings outside the United States.\",\n        source: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gothic\",\n        value: \"6\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 7,\n        title: \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\",\n        img: \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Tsunami_by_hokusai_19th_century.jpg/350px-Tsunami_by_hokusai_19th_century.jpg\",\n        details: \"\",\n        source: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa\",\n        value: \"7\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 8,\n        title: \"Café Terrace at Night\",\n        img: \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Van_Gogh_-_Terrasse_des_Caf%C3%A9s_an_der_Place_du_Forum_in_Arles_am_Abend1.jpeg/300px-Van_Gogh_-_Terrasse_des_Caf%C3%A9s_an_der_Place_du_Forum_in_Arles_am_Abend1.jpeg\",\n        details: \"Café Terrace at Night is an 1888 oil painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It is also known as The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, and, when first exhibited in 1891, was entitled Coffeehouse, in the evening (Café, le soir). Van Gogh painted Café Terrace at Night in Arles, France, in mid-September 1888. The painting is not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in three letters. \\n Visitors to the site can stand at the northeastern corner of the Place du Forum, where the artist set up his easel. The site was refurbished in 1990 and 1991 to replicate van Gogh's painting. He looked south towards the artificially lit terrace of the popular coffee house, as well as into the enforced darkness of the rue du Palais which led up to a building structure (to the left, not pictured) and, beyond this structure, the tower of a former church which is now Musée Lapidaire. \\n Towards the right, Van Gogh indicated a lighted shop as well and some branches of the trees surrounding the place, but he omitted the remainders of the Roman monuments just beside this little shop. \\n The painting is currently at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, Netherlands.\",\n        source: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Terrace_at_Night\",\n        value: \"8\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 9,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1183992/pexels-photo-1183992.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"9\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 10,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1939485/pexels-photo-1939485.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"10\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 11,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1145720/pexels-photo-1145720.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"1\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 12,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1616403/pexels-photo-1616403.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"2\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 13,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1194420/pexels-photo-1194420.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"3\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 14,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1910236/pexels-photo-1910236.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"4\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 15,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3631430/pexels-photo-3631430.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"5\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 16,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/971546/pexels-photo-971546.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"6\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 17,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1012982/pexels-photo-1012982.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"7\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 18,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1572386/pexels-photo-1572386.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"8\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 19,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1183992/pexels-photo-1183992.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"9\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 20,\n        img: \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1939485/pexels-photo-1939485.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\n        details: \"Description here\",\n        value: \"10\"\n    }\n]\n\nfunction shuffleArray() {\n    for (var i = cards.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n        var j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));\n        var temp = cards[i];\n        cards[i] = cards[j];\n        cards[j] = temp;\n    }\n}\n\nshuffleArray(cards);\n\n\nexport default cards;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
